[_Ray Tracing in One Weekend_](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html)

Implementaion ray tracing in one weekend in Rust using crate rayon and crate image.

# Unimplemented improvement
1. Rewrite vec.rs for better operations on Vector.
2. Using CUDA or Metal to accelarate the computations.
3. Rewrite the ray_color function in main.rs to non-recursive function.

# Future feature
1. Media based on ray tracing.
2. Triangles
3. Light source.
4. Texture.
